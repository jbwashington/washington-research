- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use a simple background and foreground convention for colors. The background variable is used for the background color of the component and the foreground variable is used for the text color. follow [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css) for variable names
- use HSL colors for theming
