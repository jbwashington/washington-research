- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)
- Minimize client-side state
- Use Next.js data fetching methods (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`) to manage server-side state.
- Avoid client-side data fetching methods (`useEffect`, `fetch`) except for critical, non-blocking operations.
